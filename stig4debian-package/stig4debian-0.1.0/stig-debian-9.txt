Rule Title: The file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands must match the vendor values.
Description: Discretionary access control is weakened if a user or group has access permissions to system files and directories greater than the default.\n\n
Check_content: Verify the file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands match the vendor values.\n\nCheck the file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands with the following command:\n\n# rpm -Va | grep '^.M'\n\nIf there is any output from the command indicating that the ownership or group of a system file or command, or a system file, has permissions less restrictive than the default, this is a finding.
Fixtext: Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:\n\n# rpm -qf <filename>\n\nReset the permissions of files within a package with the following command:\n\n#rpm --setperms <packagename>\n\nReset the user and group ownership of files within a package with the following command:\n\n#rpm --setugids <packagename>

Rule Title: The cryptographic hash of system files and commands must match vendor values.
Description: Without cryptographic integrity protections, system command and files can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.\n\nCryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash.
Check_content: Verify the cryptographic hash of system files and commands match the vendor values.\n\nCheck the cryptographic hash of system files and commands with the following command:\n\nNote: System configuration files (indicated by a "c" in the second column) are expected to change over time. Unusual modifications should be investigated through the system audit log.\n\n# dpkg -V | grep "^..5"\n\nIf there is any output from the command for system binaries, this is a finding.
Fixtext: Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:\n\n# dpkg -S <filename>\n\nThe package can be reinstalled from a apt repository using the command:\n\n# apt-get install --reinstall <packagename>\n\nAlternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:\n\n# dpkg -V <packagename>

Rule Title: The operating system must uniquely identify and must authenticate organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users) using multifactor authentication.
Description: To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, organizational users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system.\n\nOrganizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors). Organizational users (and processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated to all accesses, except for the following:\n\n1) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; \n\nand\n\n2) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\n\n

Rule Title: The operating system must prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.
Description: Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.\n\nPrivileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

Rule Title: A file integrity tool must verify the baseline operating system configuration at least weekly.
Description: Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.\n\nDetecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.
Check_content: Verify the operating system routinely checks the baseline configuration for unauthorized changes.\n\nNote: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed at least once per week.\n\nCheck to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:\n\n# dpkg -l aide\n\nIf AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system.\n\nCheck for the presence of a cron job running daily or weekly on the system that executes AIDE daily to scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.\n\nCheck the "/etc/cron.daily" subdirectory for a "crontab" file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:\n\n# ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        29 Nov  22  2015 aide\n\nIf the file integrity application does not exist, or a "crontab" file does not exist in the "/etc/cron.daily" or "/etc/cron.weekly" subdirectories, this is a finding.

Rule Title: Vendor packaged system security patches and updates must be installed and up to date.
Description: Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.
Check_content: Verify the operating system security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by the site or Program Management Office (PMO). \n\nObtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for updates is https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/. It is important to note that updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed.\n\nCheck that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:\n\n# aptitude search '~U'\n

Users should also ensure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.\n\nFor proper operation of the in-module integrity verification, the prelink has to be disabled. This can be done by configuring PRELINKING=no in the "/etc/sysconfig/prelink" configuration file.

Rule Title: The telnet-server package must not be installed.
Description: It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.\n\nOperating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).\n\nExamples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to, games, software packages, tools, and demonstration software not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but which cannot be disabled.
Check_content: Verify the operating system is configured to disable non-essential capabilities. The most secure way of ensuring a non-essential capability is disabled is to not have the capability installed.\n\nThe telnet service provides an unencrypted remote access service that does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session.\n\nIf a privileged user were to log on using this service, the privileged user password could be compromised. \n\nCheck to see if the telnet-server package is installed with the following command:\n\n# dpkg -s telnetd\n\nIf the telnet-server package is installed, this is a finding.

If availability is a concern, the system must alert the designated staff (System Administrator [SA] and Information System Security Officer [ISSO] at a minimum) in the event of an audit processing failure.
Description: It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.\n\nAudit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.\n\nThis requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.\n\n
Check_content: Confirm the audit configuration regarding how auditing processing failures are handled.\n\nCheck to see what level "auditctl" is set to with following command: \n\n# auditctl -l | grep /-f\n -f 2\n\nIf the value of "-f" is set to "2", the system is configured to panic (shut down) in the event of an auditing failure.\n\nIf the value of "-f" is set to "1", the system is configured to only send information to the kernel log regarding the failure.\n\nIf the "-f" flag is not set, this is a CAT I finding.\n\nIf the "-f" flag is set to any value other than "1" or "2", this is a CAT II finding.\n\nIf the "-f" flag is set to "1" but the availability concern is not documented or there is no monitoring of the kernel log, this is a CAT III finding.
Fixtext: Configure the operating system to shut down in the event of an audit processing failure.\n\nAdd or correct the option to shut down the operating system with the following command:\n\n# auditctl -f 2\n\nIf availability has been determined to be more important, and this decision is documented with the ISSO, configure the operating system to notify system administration staff and ISSO staff in the event of an audit processing failure with the following command:\n\n# auditctl -f 1\n\nKernel log monitoring must also be configured to properly alert designated staff.\n\nThe audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Rule Title: The operating system must limit the number of concurrent sessions to 10 for all accounts and/or account types.
Description: Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to DoS attacks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.

Rule Title: The host must be configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services, as defined in the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management Component Local Service Assessment (PPSM CLSA) and vulnerability assessments.
Description: In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.\n\nOperating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.\n\nTo support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.\n\n
Check_content: Inspect the firewall configuration and running services to verify that it is configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services that are unnecessary or prohibited.\n\nCheck which services are currently active with the following command:\n\n# firewall-cmd --list-all\npublic (default, active)\n  interfaces: enp0s3\n  sources: \n  services: dhcpv6-client dns http https ldaps rpc-bind ssh\n  ports: \n  masquerade: no\n  forward-ports: \n  icmp-blocks: \n  rich rules: \n\nAsk the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA.

Description: Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.\n\nOperating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.\n\nFIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD requirements. This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a general purpose computing system.\n\n
Check_content: Verify the operating system uses mechanisms meeting the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.\n\nNote: If RHEL-07-021350 is a finding, this is automatically a finding as the system cannot implement FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic algorithms and hashes.\n\nThe location of the "sshd_config" file may vary if a different daemon is in use.\n\nInspect the "Ciphers" configuration with the following command:\n\n# grep -i ciphers /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nCiphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr\n\nIf any ciphers other than "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", or "aes256-ctr" are listed, the "Ciphers" keyword is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.

Rule Title: All network connections associated with a communication session must be terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity from the user at a command prompt, except to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements.
Description: Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. \n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.
Check_content: Verify the operating system terminates all network connections associated with a communications session at the end of the session or based on inactivity.\n\nCheck the value of the system inactivity timeout with the following command:\n\n# grep -i tmout /etc/bash.bashrc \nTMOUT=600\n\nIf "TMOUT" is not set to "600" or less in "/etc/bash.bashrc", this is a finding.

This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\n

Description: DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nThis requirement addresses the configuration of the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

Description: A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.\n\nThe session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled.
Check_content: Verify the operating system prevents a user from overriding session idle delay after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces. The screen program must be installed to lock sessions on the console.\n\nNote: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable. \n\nDetermine which profile the system database is using with the following command:\n# grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user\n\nsystem-db:local\n\nCheck for the session idle delay setting with the following command:\n\nNote: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used.\n\n# grep -i idle-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*\n\n/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay\n\nIf the command does not return a result, this is a finding.
Fixtext: Configure the operating system to prevent a user from overriding a session lock after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces.\n\nCreate a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command: \n\nNote: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so if the system is using another database in /etc/dconf/profile/user, the file should be created under the appropriate subdirectory.\n\n# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/session\n\nAdd the setting to lock the session idle delay:\n\n/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay

Rule Title: When passwords are changed or new passwords are established, pwquality must be used.
Description: Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. "Pwquality" enforces complex password construction configuration on the system.
Check_content: Verify the operating system uses "pwquality" to enforce the password complexity rules. \n\nCheck for the use of "pwquality" with the following command:\n\n# grep pwquality /etc/pam.d/common-password\n\npassword    required    pam_pwquality.so retry=3\n\nIf the command does not return a line containing the value "pam_pwquality.so", this is a finding.
Fixtext: Configure the operating system to use "pwquality" to enforce password complexity rules.\n\nAdd the following line to "/etc/pam.d/common-password" (or modify the line to have the required value):\n\npassword    required    pam_pwquality.so retry=3

Rule Title: File systems that are being imported via Network File System (NFS) must be mounted to prevent binary files from being executed.
Description: The "noexec" mount option causes the system to not execute binary files. This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved binary files as they may be incompatible. Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.
Check_content: Verify file systems that are being NFS exported are mounted with the "noexec" option.\n\nFind the file system(s) that contain the directories being exported with the following command:\n\n# more /etc/fstab | grep nfs\n\nUUID=e06097bb-cfcd-437b-9e4d-a691f5662a7d    /store           nfs           rw,noexec                                                    0 0\n\nIf a file system found in "/etc/fstab" refers to NFS and it does not have the "noexec" option set, and use of NFS exported binaries is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
Fixtext: Configure the "/etc/fstab" to use the "noexec" option on file systems that are being exported via NFS.

Rule Title: The audit system must take appropriate action when there is an error sending audit records to a remote system.
Description: Taking appropriate action when there is an error sending audit records to a remote system will minimize the possibility of losing audit records.
Check_content: Verify the action the operating system takes if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system.\n\nCheck the action that takes place if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system with the following command:\n\n# grep -i network_failure_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf\nnetwork_failure_action = stop\n\nIf the value of the "network_failure_action" option is not "syslog", "single", or "halt", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Fixtext: Configure the action the operating system takes if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system.\n\nUncomment the "network_failure_action" option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" and set it to "syslog", "single", or "halt".\n\nnetwork_failure_action = single

Severity: medium
Rule Title: Wireless network adapters must be disabled.
Description: The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into the organization's network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of service to valid network resources.
Check_content: Verify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system.\n\nThis is N/A for systems that do not have wireless network adapters.\n\nCheck for the presence of active wireless interfaces with the following command:\n\n# nmcli device\nDEVICE TYPE STATE\neth0 ethernet connected\nwlp3s0 wifi disconnected\nlo loopback unmanaged\n\nIf a wireless interface is configured and its use on the system is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
Fixtext: Configure the system to disable all wireless network interfaces with the following command:\n\n#nmcli radio wifi off
